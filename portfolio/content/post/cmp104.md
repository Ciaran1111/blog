This was one of the first modules apart of my course and was also my first real experience with C++. The module is designed for all levels of programmers to help people familiarise themselves with C++ before moving onto more complex programs in later years. Having programmed before with python, java and visual basic(in school) i found myself being ahead of the module. The main assignment was to create a cyber pet game which the aim was to keep your pet alive by allowing to sleep and eat. My submission which can be seen(PUT WHERE HERE) was given an A+.
